# Smart Cultural Storyteller

Smart Cultural Storyteller is a full-stack web application that generates culturally relevant stories based on user inputs such as theme, region, language, and story length.

## Problem Statement
Cultural stories and traditions are often scattered and inaccessible to younger generations in digital form. This project aims to preserve and present cultural narratives using AI-based text generation.

## Approach
The application is built using Base44, a full-stack React-based development platform. The frontend is implemented using React components, while backend services such as AI integration and database storage are managed by the platform.

User inputs are processed through an AI text generation module, and the generated stories are displayed on the user interface and stored for later access.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
- Backend: Base44 backend services (Backend-as-a-Service)
- AI: Built-in LLM integration for text generation
- Database: Base44 entities for story storage

## Features
- AI-based cultural story generation
- Interactive story input form
- Copy and regenerate options
- Story history with search and filters
- Clean and modern UI
